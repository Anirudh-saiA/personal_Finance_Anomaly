Personal Finance Anomaly Detector
A full-stack web application that uses machine learning to detect anomalies in personal financial statements, providing users with interactive visualizations and insights into their spending habits.

Live Application: https://personal-finance-anomaly.vercel.app/

(Suggestion: Replace the placeholder above with a real screenshot of your application's dashboard)

üåü Key Features
ML-Powered Anomaly Detection: Upload a CSV of your bank statement, and the backend uses an IsolationForest model to identify unusual transactions that deviate from your normal spending patterns.

Interactive Data Visualization: An intuitive dashboard displays your financial summary, monthly spending trends (Bar Chart), and spending breakdown by category (Pie Chart).

Secure User Authentication: Users can create an account and log in securely, with authentication managed by Firebase.

Live Financial News Feed: A public homepage displays the latest business and finance news fetched in real-time from a third-party API.

Upload & Analysis History: Every analysis is automatically saved to a Firestore database. A dedicated "History" page allows users to view and reload past analyses without re-uploading files.

Responsive Design: The interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
